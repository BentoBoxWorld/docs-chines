## What it does
This addon will give players a separate inventory, health, food level, advancements and experience for each gamemode installed and their corresponding worlds. It enables players to play each gamemode independently of each other.

## An example
**BSkyBlock**'s Inventory, Health, Food level, Advancements and Experience are shared only between its corresponding worlds:
- BSkyBlock_world
- BSkyBlock_world_nether
- BSkyBlock_world_the_end

**Please note:**
- It is not limited to just BentoBox worlds. It applies to all worlds on the server (right now).
