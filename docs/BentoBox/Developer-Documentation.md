# Welcome to the BentoBox developer documentation!

BentoBox is a platform plugin that supports a suite of API's for addons that run on it. The architecture is virtually identical to the Bukkit plugin system. You can create GameModeAddons like BSkyBlock that provide players with your own game mode experience, or you can develop utility plugins, like Warps that enable players in any game mode (or even normal worlds) to use warp signs.

# JavaDocs
Javadocs are here: [https://javadocs.bentobox.world](https://javadocs.bentobox.world)

The core API package is world.bentobox.bentobox.api.*. Methods in those packages are kept as stable as possible over the long term. Methods and classes outside of the api package may change a lot or more frequently.

# Example Addon
