(Credit: 1213videogamer on PlanetMinecraft ). If you start seeing superflat chunks being generated in your world, then it is because the world generator is not working for the world anymore. There are a few reasons why this may be the case. They are ordered according to their likeliness. We strongly recommend you revert to backups made prior to this situation . Although we are providing instructions to help recover from such an event in case you do not have backups available, we do not guarantee their effectiveness . Moreover, these solutions are designed to address the problem as much as possible, however, ignoring the impact on performance or player islands . Use them knowingly. As a quick fix, there is a setting in the admin settings console to remove super flat chunks. This is the main tool to fix the damage, but unless you fix the root cause it will just cause super lag and never fix the issue properly. In any case, stop your server immediately to prevent further damage from being done to your worlds . Causes # BentoBox or the Gamemode addon is no longer running # Why? BentoBox or the Gamemode addon is not enabled on the server. This can occur if you updated BentoBox or the Gamemode addon to a version which is not compatible with your server or which is incompatible with one of your plugins. Solutions Investigate as to why BentoBox or the Gamemode addon is no longer enabled. Read the logs to find errors at startup. Try booting your server up while adding a single plugin at a time to find out which plugin is causing the issue. There is no generator set for this world in the bukkit.yml file # Why? This is often the situation. While setting the default world of your server to be the Gamemode addon's world, you forgot to specify the right generator for said world in the bukkit.yml file. Solutions Make sure you followed each step of this tutorial thoroughly. The use-own-generator option from the Gamemode's config is set to true # Why? This is a common mistake. Users tend to misunderstand this option as allowing them to activate a \"magic\" cobblestone generator (but it's an addon !). This is indeed not what this option is designed for, and this is clearly explained in the comments surrounding this option in the config file: # Use your own world generator for this world. # In this case, the plugin will not generate anything. # If used, you must specify the world name and generator in the bukkit.yml file. # See https://bukkit.gamepedia.com/Bukkit.yml use-own-generator : false Ultimately, this can also happen if you forgot the specify the world name and generator in the bukkit.yml file. Solutions If you do not plan to use an external plugin to generate the world, then you should set this option back to false . On the contrary, you should make sure you have specified the world name and the corresponding plugin name as its generator in the bukkit.yml file. Another plugin is trying to control the generator of this world # Why? Although very rare, this can still happen. Some plugins, especially world management ones (e.g. Multiverse), tend to provide settings that could override the generator of our worlds. Solutions Review all of your plugins to find out which one is the most likely to cause the issue. World management plugins or custom-coded ones that are interacting with worlds are to be investigated first. Either report the issue to their developers or fix the configuration files that are involved. There is a bug in BentoBox or in the Gamemode addon # Why? Woopsie! Nowadays, this is extremely rare. But it might still happen for some reasons. Solutions Make sure this is actually a BentoBox-related bug: remove all the plugins from your server one by one until only BentoBox is left. If the issue is no longer occurring, this means another plugin is causing it. In that case, please refer yourself to this section . If the issue still occurs, this means this is a BentoBox bug. Please report it on our bug tracker . How to clean the superflat chunks afterwards? # If you have backups, use them to revert your server's worlds and BentoBox databases to their previous states. If you do not have backups, log into your server and open the Admin Settings Panel using the /[admin-command] settings command. Find the \" Clean Super Flat \" flag and toggle it on. Depending on your settings, locales and on the BentoBox version you are running, the name, icon or description might be different. But we are sure you will be able to find that flag by yourself nonetheless! The Clean Super Flat flag in BSkyBlock's Admin Settings Panel . This flag will slowly regenerate any superflat chunk from your world over time . This happens when chunks are loaded, so you might want to either teleport to said chunks to force the regeneration, or you could leave the flag enabled for a few days. Do not forget to disable the flag at some point! It is quite resource-intensive... My server lags when a player creates their island! # Pasting the island or generating the chunks are the main causes of this issue. Firstly, the paste speed may be too much for your server. Try lowering it. Look in the BentoBox config.yml for this setting: # Number of blocks to paste per tick when pasting blueprints. # Smaller values will help reduce noticeable lag but will make pasting take slightly longer. # On the contrary, greater values will make pasting take less time, but this benefit is quickly severely impacted by the # resulting amount of chunks that must be loaded to fulfill the process, which often causes the server to hang out. paste-speed : 64 If you are running timings, the BlueprintPaster task should ideally be taking a long time, yet take a low percentage of a tick time. If the server still struggles when pasting islands, then that implies it struggles to generate the chunks. That is something we have little control on as a plugin, but here are a few things you could do to mitigate this: Try reducing the \"distance between islands\" setting in the gamemode's config file. Lower values means fewer chunks to generate. This will require you to entirely reset the worlds and databases. Use Paper as your server software. Paper handles asynchronous chunk generation. Pre-generate the world. Especially for gamemodes whose generators are resource-intensive, such as CaveBlock or SkyGrid. I can't place saplings on my island! # Relevant issue: BentoBox#277 . If no message shows up to the player telling them that they can't place the sapling, then it means that BentoBox does not cause this issue. If you are using GriefPrevention on your server, there is a config option in this plugin that prevents players from placing so-called \"Sky Trees\". How do I change the island distance? # All the game modes have a configuration for the distance between player islands. In BSkyBlock, is is called distance-between-islands and it is found in the config.yml file here: # Radius of island in blocks. (So distance between islands is twice this) # It is the same for every dimension : Overworld, Nether and End. # This value cannot be changed mid-game and the plugin will not start if it is different. # /!\\ BentoBox currently does not support changing this value mid-game. If you do need to change it, do a full reset of your databases and worlds. distance-between-islands: 400 In the case of BSkyBlock, the default value is 400, which means that players will start 800 blocks apart from each other. It also means that a player's protection area can grow up to a value of 400. Most of the time, the default setting should be sufficient for your server. However, some admins like to space out players even further, or sometimes, have them closer together. Whatever you choose, once the game is running, you cannot change this value . If you do try to change it, BentoBox will refuse to start and give a warning in the console like this: [14:08:20 ERROR]: [BentoBox] *****************CRITIAL ERROR!****************** [14:08:20 ERROR]: [BentoBox] Island distance mismatch! World 'bskyblock_world' distance 800 != island range 400! Island ID in database is BSkyBlock99ea1c15-f5f8-410a-9019-d6b843a5a254. Island distance in config.yml cannot be changed mid-game! Fix config.yml or clean database. [14:08:20 ERROR]: [BentoBox] Could not load islands! Disabling BentoBox... [14:08:20 ERROR]: [BentoBox] ************************************************* This is a protection mechanism, because if you do change the value and were able to proceed, islands could end up on top of each other and that would lead to very unhappy players! But I am just starting my server! How do I change this value and clean the database? I will assume you are using the default JSON database (flat file). Follow these steps: Stop the server Change the config.yml value for the island distance to whatever you want. If you have no other BentoBox games running, or just want to reset everything, then delete the plugins/BentoBox/database and the plugins/BentoBox/database_backup folders Delete the worlds that the game modes made, for BSkyBlock, this is by default these folders in your server folder: bskyblock_world , bskyblock_world_nether , and bskyblock_world_the_end Restart the server. If you already have other BentoBox game modes running on your server, then things are a little more complex: 1. Stop the server 2. Change the config.yml value for the island distance to whatever you want. 3. Open the plugins/BentoBox/database/Island folder and delete all the files that start with the name of your game mode, e.g., BSkyBlock99ea1c15-f5f8-410a-9019-d6b843a5a254.json 4. Delete the worlds that the game modes made, for BSkyBlock, this is by default these folders in your server folder: bskyblock_world , bskyblock_world_nether , and bskyblock_world_the_end 5. Restart the server. If you are using other databases like MySQL, then the steps are the same, but you will need to use SQL commands to remove the database, tables, or entries. How can I enable nether portals to link together? # In BentoBox 1.16 we implemented an option to properly link together portals. However this option works only if allow-nether is enabled in server.properties and allow-end in bukkit.yml. To enable linking nether portals you need to find option in gamemode config: create-and-link-portals and set it to true . To enable creating proper end obsidian platform (like in vanilla end) you need to find option create-obsidian-platform and set it to true . Be aware, that enabling these options opens the same exploits with unlimitated obsidian generation that original Minecraft has. API # How do I start writing addons for BentoBox?

Introduction # This specification defines a format that describes a region (made up of blocks and entities) of a Minecraft world for the purpose of serialization and storage to disk or to JSON-based database.

Blueprints are like WorldEdit schematics but are not compatible. Blueprints are optimized for BentoBox addons and do not require any other plugin or library to use. Blueprints are managed with the Blueprint Manager and can be bundled together into a Blueprint Bundle to contain a set of up to 3 islands (normal world, nether and end world). Blueprint Bundles can have their own icon, description and can contain other settings, like requiring permission to use. FAQ: I have a lot of schematics - how do I convert them to Blueprints? # It's quite easy, but you have to do it in-game because you'll need to add some signs to it. Steps: Load the schematic using WorldEdit Paste it somewhere, I recommend some space in the BSKyBlock world away from everything Find where you want the player to spawn and place a sign there with the text [spawn_here] on it. (Optional) Place a welcome sign facing the place that has the text [start] on it. For details on these signs, look below Select the island using the admin blueprint commands pos1 and pos2 (Remember to use the blueprint command and not WE!) Copy the island using the admin blueprint copy command Save the island using the admin blueprint save command Repeat for all your islands including Nether and End islands. Tips: Make sure you have a bedrock block in the center of the island. This is where the island will be centered around. Asynchronous # All Blueprint copying and pasting is done async and should never lag the server no matter how large the Blueprint. It can take a number of seconds to paste very large Blueprints. You can set how many blocks will be copied or pasted by editing the paste speed in BentoBox's config.yml. The default should be acceptable for most systems. If you run timings, you may see the pasting process taking a long time, but it is just doing about 1000 blocks per tick and should not be lagging your system. Operation # The basic flow for making a custom island: Create a bounding box by setting two positions at opposite corners of the box - set pos1 and pos2 Copy the contents of the box to the clipboard Save the contents. If you just want to overwrite the default islands, save as \"island\", \"nether-island\" or \"end-island\" - you will be asked to confirm the overwriting. Open up the Blueprint Manager, e.g., /bsb blueprint to make a new Bundle, set icons, group Blueprints, etc. Video # Click on the thumbnail! Commands # The commands are almost the same as WorldEdit schematic commands. You must be Op or an admin with permissions to use blueprints. Use the admin command and blueprint or its alias bp : /bsb bp pos1 - set one corner of the bounding box to the position of your player /bsb bp pos2 - set the other corner /bsb bp copy - copy the blocks and entities inside the box to the clipboard /bsb bp copy air - copy the blocks, entities, and air inside the box to the clipboard. This is important if you plan to paste the island into water (AcidIsland) or rock (CaveBlock). /bsb bp paste - paste the clipboard to your location /bsb bp save - saves the clipboard to a file (appends a .schem suffix) /bsb bp load - load a blueprint file (do not append the .schem suffix) /bsb bp - open the Blueprint Manager GUI For AcidIsland, use /acid instead of /bsb. Blueprint Manager GUI # The Blueprint Manager GUI enables you to create, edit and configure the island sets that players can select when they start a new island or reset. The sets of islands (normal world, nether world, and end world) are called \"bundles\". There is a default bundle that can be customized, but not deleted. To create a new bundle, click on the green banner in the bottom left corner of the GUI. Text entry is done via the chat interface. Enter a name for the new bundle. You can change it later. The new bundle will have a default red wool icon and a name. It has three slots to the right that represent the places where you can put 3 blueprints: Green glass pane - this is the normal world blueprint slot Red glass pane - this is the nether world blueprint slot Yellow glass pane - this is the end world blueprint slot Right click on these slots to clear them. Below the line of dark gray glass panes, you will see a number of blueprints to choose. Click on the one you want and it will glow. Then click on the slot where you want to put it. You can put the same blueprint in all three slots or have different blueprints for each one, it is up to you. To add a description to the bundle right click on the bundle icon and enter a description in the chat. Keep each line short so the GUI does not look too big. You can set the text color using Bukkit color codes, like &c for red. To change a bundle's icon, click on an item in your inventory and it will replace the bundle's icon. To change a blueprint's icon, select the blueprint and then click on the inventory item. To limit a bundle to players with the right permission, click the picture item to toggle whether permission is required or not. The icon will show what permission is required in its text (it is based on the name of the bundle). The permission is GameModeAddonName.island.create.uniqueId of blueprint bundle. e.g. bskyblock.island.create.vip . To delete a bundle, right click on the TNT. Bundles and blueprints must be renamed in the GUI. Do not try to rename them using the file system. Files and Editing # When using blueprints in the game, always use just the name of the blueprint. On the file system, blueprints are saved in a compressed format with the .blu suffix and blueprint bundles are saved as .json text files. You can edit the JSON blueprint bundles with a text editor, but you should never edit .blu files outside of the game. Incomplete bundles # Bundles must always have an Overworld/Normal world blueprint. If they do not, then the default island (island.blu) blueprint will be used and an error logged in the console. Bundles do not have to have Nether or End World blueprints, but if they do not, no island will be pasted in those worlds (obviously). Entities # Coming in BentoBox 1.14.0 In this upcoming release, you will also be able to use [name] , which will be replaced by the island owner's name when creating the island. You can use placeholders in entities' names. Rename a name tag with the placeholder in an anvil, then apply the name tag to the entity. Signs # Blueprints can have two special signs in them to help you place where a player will spawn and to give them a welcome message. Spawn Here Sign # Place a sign with the first line as [spawn_here] where you want the player to spawn. They will appear in this position and the sign will not be pasted. This applies to all world islands, so you can specify where players will appear in the Nether when they go through a portal, for example. Welcome Sign # The welcome sign provides a friendly way to give players a hint about the game and what to do, or not do! Place a sign with [start] on the first line. The sign's text will be replaced by the sign text in the GameModeAddon's locale file. Tips & Recommendations # We recommend that you keep starting islands small to make the game a challenge. Put just enough items and blocks on an island for players to be able to grow their island. Try making split islands (think up and down, side to side) to give players a target to build to when they have the resources. If you are copying with air, try to make your bounding box as small as possible to keep the file size small. After copying a blueprint, try pasting it to check it was copied correctly.

What makes it a game mode add-on is that it will create and register a world with BentoBox and supply BentoBox with a WorldSettings class object. Currently, worlds registered with BentoBox must be over-worlds, but once a world is registered, any associated Nether and End worlds will also belong to this game mode add-on. To show how this all works, let's look at the BSkyBlock code (some lines removed for clarity): [source,java] # @Override public void onLoad() { // Save the default config from config.yml saveDefaultConfig(); // Load settings from config.yml. This will check if there are any issues with it too. settings = new Config<>(this, Settings.class).loadConfigObject(); // Load or create worlds bsbWorlds = new BSkyBlockWorld(this); } The comments are pretty clear, but the first two calls are to set up the config.yml file and the settings. In this case, we are using the Config class from the BentoBox Configuration API which enables dynamic saving of YAML files with comments. This is a powerful config API. You do not have to use it if you do not want to. Instead, you can just use the regular Bukkit-style config system. We used it because it enables us to keep the config.yml file up to date automatically. = The Settings Class Let's look at the Settings class (again, some lines have been removed for clarity): [source,java] # @StoreAt(filename=\"config.yml\", path=\"addons/BSkyBlock\") // Explicitly call out what name this should have. @ConfigComment(\"BSkyBlock Configuration [version]\") @ConfigComment(\"This config file is dynamic and saved when the server is shutdown.\") @ConfigComment(\"You cannot edit it while the server is running because changes will\") @ConfigComment(\"be lost! Use in-game settings GUI or edit when server is offline.\") @ConfigComment(\"\") public class Settings implements DataObject, WorldSettings { @ConfigComment(\"Allow obsidian to be scooped up with an empty bucket back into lava\") @ConfigEntry(path = \"general.allow-obsidian-scooping\") private boolean allowObsidianScooping = true; ... # What you see here are a lot of notations followed by the class declaration, followed by more notations around a field declaration. Let's take these one by one: . The @StoreAt annotation before the class defines where this config file will be stored. It is relative to the data folder of the BentoBox plugin. Files should only ever be stored within the BentoBox folder. It is very important that you declare this location explicitly! . The @Comment annotation is used to add a line of comment into the YAML file. The \"[version]\" placeholder is automatically replaced with the version number of the add-on. . The class must implement both DataObject and WorldSettings. DataObject is used so the class can be saved in the database (via BBConfig) and WorldSettings is used because this is a Game Mode add-on . The field \"allowObsidianScooping\" is declared, along with a default value and it has a comment annotation and a @ConfigEntry annotation. This one is used to define where this value will be placed in the YAML file. Note that YAML entries are generally placed in the same order as they are written in the code unless the @ConfigEntry forces them to be placed elsewhere. . After the field is declared, you also need to create a getter and setter for the field. (Not shown in the code) Note that by implementing the WorldSetting interface, you will have to @Override a number of getters for mandatory world settings. In the BSkyBlock Settings class almost all of these are loaded from the config file. One exception is the Optional getAddon() . This must return the add-on instance. Right now, the add-on must set this. In the future, BentoBox may set it. = Registering the World with BentoBox Now let's take a closer look at the BSkyBlockWorld class mentioned above. This class does three main things: . Makes the worlds for BSkyBlock (creates the worlds and defines generators for them) . Registers the main over world and the settings class with BentoBox . Registers the schems that will be used when creating new islands with the IslandCreate class This is how it does it: [source,java] # // Create the world if it does not exist islandWorld = WorldCreator.name(worldName).type(WorldType.FLAT).environment(World.Environment.NORMAL) .generator(new ChunkGeneratorWorld(addon)).createWorld(); // Register the world and settings with BentoBox addon.getPlugin().registerWorld(islandWorld, addon.getSettings()); // Make the nether and end worlds if required (not shown) // Load schematics addon.getPlugin().getSchemsManager().loadIslands(islandWorld); In this code, addon is the add-on instance. getPlugin() is used to get BentoBox and registerWorld() is used to register the world. Note that you do NOT register the nether and end worlds with BentoBox. You only register the overworld. BentoBox will assume that any associated Nether or End are also owned by your add-on if they exist. For schems, (BentoBox's own proprietary schematics file format), you should have schems for the default island for each world in your add-on's schems folder. They must be named as follows: island.schem (Mandatory) nether-island.schem (Optional) end-island.schem (Optional) To make schems, use BentoBox's schem command (or BSkyBlock's or AcidIsland's schem command). = Registering commands After you have registered the world, the associated world/game mode settings and the schems, the next step is to make your add-on do something. If it requires commands, you can make them by extending CompositeCommand. Let's look at how BSkyBlock registers it's top-level command /island and sub commands under it: [source,java] # public class IslandCommand extends CompositeCommand { public IslandCommand(BSkyBlock addon) { super(addon, \"island\", \"is\"); } @Override public void setup() { setOnlyPlayer(true); // Permission setPermissionPrefix(\"bskyblock\"); setPermission(\"island\"); setWorld(((BSkyBlock)getAddon()).getIslandWorld()); // Set up subcommands new IslandAboutCommand(this); new IslandCreateCommand(this); new IslandGoCommand(this); new IslandResetCommand(this); new IslandSetnameCommand(this); new IslandResetnameCommand(this); new IslandSethomeCommand(this); new IslandSettingsCommand(this); new IslandLanguageCommand(this); new IslandBanCommand(this); new IslandUnbanCommand(this); new IslandBanlistCommand(this); // Team commands new IslandTeamCommand(this); } The key line for registering the command is: super(addon, \"island\", \"is\"); This tells BentoBox that \"/island\" is a top-level command for BSkyBlock add-on and it has an alias of \"/is\". Then in the setup() method, there are a number of very important (mandatory for top-level commands) declarations: setWorld(((BSkyBlock)getAddon()).getIslandWorld()); This is extremely important. It defines the world that this command will operate in. All sub-commands will refer to this using the getWorld() method. After that, the command instantiates a number of sub-commands, passing itself as a parameter. These classes will use that parameter as the parent in their respective super() calls. = Conclusion The above describes what should be done if you are creating a new game mode type add-on.

In this case, we are using the Config class from the BentoBox Configuration API which enables dynamic saving of YAML files with comments. This is a powerful config API. You do not have to use it if you do not want to. Instead, you can just use the regular Bukkit-style config system.

Files should only ever be stored within the BentoBox folder. It is very important that you declare this location explicitly! . The @Comment annotation is used to add a line of comment into the YAML file. The \"[version]\" placeholder is automatically replaced with the version number of the add-on. .

The BentoBox database can be chosen to store data in a flat-file, MySQL, Mongo, SQLite, PostGreSQL, MariaDB, etc. You do not have to worry or care about which one is used. Note that YAML is no longer supported as a database, however it is used for configuration files via the Config API. Philosophy # We have taken a \"NoSQL\" approach to the BentoBox database. i.e., we store serialized Java objects as JSON \"blobs\" in the database. Each table in the database is assigned to store a specific Java object, e.g., islands, players, challenges, etc. and each entry in the table is one object. The tables have two columns - a unique ID and the JSON object. Databases such as PostgreSQL can store these JSON objects in a binary form, which makes them handle this approach efficiently. How do I access the data from outside BentoBox? # Most of the supported databases, e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc. support queries on the JSON data directly. The only ones that do not are flat-file based, i.e., JSON and SQLite. Therefore, you should look up the documentation on how to make JSON queries for your database. How To # To store a class in the BentoBox database do the following: Create a class that extends DataObject Define the fields of the class One field must be a string called uniqueId . This is the unique id (key) of the object that will be used by the database to identify the object Expose every field you want to store in the database with an @Expose annotation Ensure the class has a zero argument constructor Create a getter and setter for every field - most IDEs should be able to do that for you automatically WARNING: The full canonical name of the class is used to create the table in the database, but the maximum length of that name can only be 64 characters . So when you define the data object class, make sure that the package and class names are short enough to fit. ALSO as BentoBox allows database tables to have a prefix, make sure your canonical name is less than about 60 characters in total to allow for a prefix. For some field types, especially custom ones, you may have to define your own Adapter class that will handle serialization and deserialization of the field's data. Example # public class Names implements DataObject { @Expose private String uniqueId = \"\"; // name @Expose private UUID uuid; public Names() {} public Names(String name, UUID uuid) { this.uniqueId = name; this.uuid = uuid; } @Override public String getUniqueId() { return uniqueId; } @Override public void setUniqueId(String uniqueId) { this.uniqueId = uniqueId; } /** * @return the uuid */ public UUID getUuid() { return uuid; } /** * @param uuid the uuid to set */ public void setUuid(UUID uuid) { this.uuid = uuid; } } uniqueID # The DataObject interface contract requires you to override getUniqueId() and a setUniqueID() methods. The uniqueId is a string that is used to identify the data object in the database. A typical uniqueId is the player's UUID (converted to String). If there is only ever going to be one database object, this uniqueId can be a constant, e.g., \"TopTen\". The uniqueId only has to be to be unique within the scope of data objects of the type you made. It does not have to be unique for every data object ever. Instantiating the database object # Once you have created the data object, you must instantiate it to use it. You do that by creating a new BSBDatabase object with BSkyBlock as the first argument and your class as the second. For example: BSBDatabase<Names> names = new BSBDatabase<>(plugin, Names.class); Saving data to the database # To write data to the database, do the following: Create an instance of your database object, in this example, the Names class Put data into it, either via the constructor or using the setters Save it to the database using the saveObject() method For example: names.saveObject(new Names(user.getName(), user.getUniqueId())); You can save multiple objects to the database by repeating the saveObject method calls. If the object has the same uniqueId as a previously saved object, it will be automatically overwritten. Loading data from the database # There are two ways to load data - load specific records (objects) by uniqueId, or load all the objects of this type in one go. Loading a single object # To do this, you must know the uniqueId of the record you want. Then use the loadObject method with the uniqueId as the argument. For example: Names loadedName = names.loadObject(\"tastybento\"); If you know what data you want from the loaded object and you are sure it exists, you can grab it directly: UUID uuid = names.loadObject(string).getUuid(); Loading all the objects # Sometimes you need to load the whole database into memory so it can be accessed all the time. Try not to do this unless you need it. To load all the objects, use the loadObjects() method. This will load them all in as a List. For example: List<UUID> uuids = names.loadObjects(); Note that loading from a database may take a long time and so should not be done on the main thread during the game. You should be able to load objects in an async thread. Checking if an object exists in the database # To check if an object exists, you must have its uniqueId. Check it like this example: `return names.objectExists(\"tastybento\") ? \"he exists in the db\" : \"who?\";' Checking for object existence can also take a long time, so do not do this on the main thread if you can avoid it. Deleting an object in the database # Removing an object requires that you know the uniqueId. Delete objects like this: names.deleteObject(\"tastybento\"); The method will log an error in the console if it cannot delete the object, but otherwise it will be silent. Currently, there is no way to delete all objects in the database. Closing the database # Database connections are set to auto close when the plugin is disabled, but if you wish to explicitly close the connection to save resources, use this method: names.close() This will release the connection object's database and any JDBC resources immediately instead of waiting for them to be automatically released. Object type support # YAML database is no longer supported! The database uses GSON to serialize the object. This handles most generic object types and all Bukkit classes that implement the ConfigurationSerializable interface, for example: World Location Vector (Bukkit's Vector) PotionEffectType etc. If you implement an object that must be serialized and stored in the database then it should implement Bukkit's ConfigurationSerializable interface.","title":"Database API"},{"location":"BentoBox/Database-API/#introduction","text":"BentoBox provides a database API for developers so you do not have to make one yourself.

We at BentoBoxWorld have discussed lengthily the most user-friendly installation method that would fit the best the defining features of BentoBox. Compared to most Spigot plugins, BentoBox's installation will take a bit more time than a quick drag-and-drop in your server's plugins folder; but the countless possibilities it will bring you are worth it. Let's get started! Download BentoBox # You can download BentoBox for free on different websites. Official releases can be found on the plugin's Spigot page or in the GitHub Releases tab , whereas untested development builds can be downloaded from Jenkins . Setup BentoBox # Once you have downloaded BentoBox, you have to put it in your server's plugins folder. Unlike ASkyBlock, there are no required dependencies: BentoBox will automatically hook into plugins it finds (such as Vault, PlaceholderAPI, Multiverse-Core, ...) to extend its capacity. Boot up your server and wait until all plugins are fully enabled. If you connect on your server, you will notice BentoBox doesn't do anything special. As a matter of fact, BentoBox does nothing on its own : it needs you to add Addons so it can \"learn\" to manage e.g. the Skyblock gamemode. Now, turn off your server. You can have a look at BentoBox's config.yml file. Install Addons # Addons are what makes BentoBox special. However, note that these are not plugins : they won't launch if you just put them in the plugins folder. Firstly, you need to download the Addons you want to add to your server. Official ones can be found in BentoBoxWorld's repositories list and can be downloaded from their Releases tab (or from Jenkins for untested development builds). We will setup a website at some point so it gets easier for you to download them later on. Once you have downloaded everything you need, you just have to put them all in the plugins\\BentoBox\\addons folder, boot up your server so that config files and folders get created, and finally turn it off again in order to be able to edit everything without causing any harm to your server. Please note that Addons may sometimes be incompatible with the version of BentoBox you're using. Official Addons will always be provided with a clear statement of which version they support. However, note that they often support newer versions without needing to be updated. Conclusion # You should be good to go!

This enables addons that do not need or want to handle their own database storage to store data using this API instead. For example, the Border addon only needs to store a simple boolean that records whether the border is switched on or off for the user. It would be overkill to store this in a database table, so instead, the addon can place this boolean into the Player object by way of the User class. Quick Example # Setting metadata # Set the metadata by supplying a string key and a new MetaDataValue with the object you want to store. // Place a boolean tag on the user with the value of true and name it Border_state user.putMetaData(\"Border_state\", new MetaDataValue(true)); Checking metadata # Metadata is read by supplying a string key. The return is an Optional that you can check to see if it exists or not // Check if the user has the metadata called Border_state boolean on = user.getMetaData(\"Border_state\").map(md -> md.asBoolean()).orElse(false); Remember, getMetaData returns an Optional so if you check for a metadata key and it does not exist, then you will get an Optional.empty() . So if you wish to check explicitly if a tag exists or not, use isPresent() : if (user.getMetaData(\"My_key\").isPresent()) { // Do something } else { // Do something else } Of course, you can also use the ifPresent() method to perform an action like this: user.getMetaData(\"My_key\").ifPresent(key -> System.out.println(\"Your key value is \" + key.asInt())); However, usually, you want to grab the value and do something with it, so the map() and orElse() syntax is the most helpful.

Configuration is done in-game via the admin or player settings, and out of game via permissions and config files. What is Protection? # Multiplayer Minecraft provides no built-in protection for the map except for the area immediately around spawn. As a result, any random player can damage or \"grief\" someone else's area that they have put time into. With BentoBox, players have their own islands and the protection system prevents or limits what other players can do in this space. Protection also extends to limiting which commands can be executed. For example, an admin can prevent teleportation commands from being run when a player is falling to prevent them cheating fall damage. What about WorldGuard? # WorldGuard is a protection plugin that also provides protection functions. BentoBox does not use WorldGuard and it is recommended that it is turned off in BentoBox worlds to avoid clashes. Admins can use WorldGuard if they like in BentoBox worlds, but they should consider that there may be clashes between the two systems. How is Protection Managed In BentoBox? # BentoBox uses the concept of \"flags\" to manage protection settings. There are three types of flags: Protection flags - these are explicitly designed to allow or disallow some facet of world or island protection. Settings flags - these are generally true/false or on/off settings that can be applied. They may provide protection. World Settings flags - these are settings flags that determine how things operate in the game world in general. Protected areas # BentoBox has two areas of protection: The player's island Everywhere else, the rest of the world These areas are generally handled independently, but certain world settings may apply to the player's island. Island owners generally have the ability to set the settings for their own island and admins configure the settings for everywhere else. Admins also can determine the default settings for an island to have by adjusting the game mode's config.yml . The player's island protection area is set by default in the game mode's config.yml and can be expanded or reduced in-game via admin commands or by the player having a permission. The maximum protection size is governed by the distance between islands, which is also set in the game mode config.yml . Changing Settings # BentoBox provides an island settings GUI to island owners that enables them to see the island settings. Admins can reduce the island settings visible via the admin settings GUI. Admins can allow players to change settings via permissions. The default is that players can change all the settings they can see. Protection Provided # There are a lot of protection flags and new ones are added. This section covers the most important levels of protection. Protections can be restricted for the various ranks available, i.e.: Visitor Coop Trusted Member Sub-Owner Owners can always do everything. Every time a player tries to do something in a protected area, BentoBox will determine if they have the right to do it or not. If they do not, they will be blocked from doing it and depending on the type of activity told that they cannot do it. Finding out why something can or cannot be done # BentoBox provides an admin tool to explain why something can or cannot be done. It is the admin why <player> command, e.g., /bsb why tastybento . When this is used, the console will record the reason why the player can do something or cannot. This can help admins understand their settings. Also, if the why command says that a player can do something but in-game they cannot, then that indicates another plugin (or the server itself) is preventing the action. Protections # Breaking and Placing Blocks Block Interaction Containers Anvils Buttons Beds Doors and trap doors Beacons Brewing stands Cauldrons Barrels Beehives Bee nests Composters Furnaces, smokers, and campfires Enchanting tables Jukeboxes and note blocks Crafting tables Levers Redstone-related blocks Dragon Eggs Item Frames Berry picking Cake eating Gate usage Breeding Bucket use Dye use Egg use Elytra use Interaction with: Vehicles, including boats, minecrarts and ridable animals like horses, etc. Villager trading Name tag protection Item or experience pickup or item dropping Fire-related: prevention of ignition, spreading, burning, lightning-related, etc. Damaging or hurting monsters or animals Leash use Lectern use Physical interactions Portal use Sheering Teleportation, e.g., using chorus fruit or ender pearls Throwing of items, including potions TNT or other explosion protections Island Settings # These are settings that an owner can change for their island. Admins should configure permissions appropriately to allow or disallow them. PVP - Player vs Player - see the PVP Section below Leaf decay - determines whether leaf blocks decay or not Mob spawning - handles whether monsters or animals should spawn on the island, either naturally or due to spawner blocks World Settings # These settings are for admins to determine. Players may be able to view them as well in a read-only mode. This may help players understand what type of server they are playing on and what is allowed or not. Chest explosion damage - this protects chests from being damaged by explosions. Explosions could be due to Creepers, TNT cannons, Wither or Ghast explosions, etc. The default is to prevent chests from being broken. Although this provides good protection for players, it does provide a somewhat exploitable system whereby indestructible rooms can be made with chests, e.g., to hold a Wither. Admins should consider the tradeoff. Cleaning up a super-flat world - in rare situations, the world generation of a BentoBox world may not be running or malfunction. As most BentoBox worlds are officially \"super-flat\" worlds according to the server, new world chunks will be created as super-flat chunks. These are a few layers of blocks starting at y=0 and covered in grass. Admins can recover from a world where super-flat chunks exist by switching this setting on. It will detect super-flat chunks and try to convert them to the game mode's chunk type, e.g. void. This process can lag the server so it should not be left on unless it is required. Recovered chunks are reported in the console log. Coarse Dirt Tilling Prevention - this setting is to prevent players from making dirt out of coarse dirt. In a number of BentoBox game modes, dirt is highly prized because it cannot be crafted, but it can be used to grow crops, feed sheep, etc. The Level addon will score dirt blocks higher than other blocks for this reason. Dirt is rare and given out sparingly. Coarse dirt enables dirt to be created by mixing it with gravel. If the Game Mode allows players to obtain gravel easily, e.g., via the vanilla Nether world, then coarse dirt making can be exploited to make dirt. The default setting is to disallow coarse dirt tilling, but it can probably be allowed so long as gravel is not too readily available. Creeper protection - Creepers explode and BentoBox provides a few ways to handle them Prevent damage from the explosion - this will switch off the explosive damage of a creeper. Creepers are the number one way that an island can be destroyed and admins may not want to deal with players crying about their island being blown up. However, preventing this makes the game a lot easier. Prevent visitors from lighting creepers on other islands - this is a type of griefing where a visitor can use flint & steel to prime a creeper and make it explode with the purpose of getting access to parts of another island, or just for fun. BentoBox is able to identify whether the player is a visitor or not and prevent this action. Ender Chests - access and crafting of Ender Chests are prevented by default because they provide a method for players to obtain items from other worlds. If the admin has a per-world Ender Chest plugin, then this setting can be switched off. Enderman protection - Endermen will randomly pick up blocks from islands. BentoBox. As this can lead to players complaining to admins about missing blocks, there is a setting to prevent this. Geo-Limiting of mobs - Some mobs, especially flying mobs can be spawned on one island and then potentially move outside of that island and enter other player's islands. For destructive mobs like the Wither, this is undesirable. This setting prevents the specified mobs from exiting the island. If they do, they are removed from the game. Visitor Protection - part of the fun of a multi-player game is having other players visit your island and see all the hard work you have done. However, some players see visitors as prey and try to develop ways to kill or harm them. BentoBox by default protects visitors from most harm. All types of Minecraft damage can be switched off. If a visitor falls into the void, they can be teleported to safety. Admins can configure what type of damage is prevented via the admin settings menu. Item frame protection - these have their own protection because they can be used in a variety of ways. The default is to protect them from being damaged and dropping the item in them. Global mob spawning limitations - admins can use this setting to decide which mob types can spawn in the world. For example, Phantoms can be switched off. This setting overrides any other settings or spawning mechanisms, e.g. spawn eggs or spawner blocks. Liquid management - players can abuse the ability of liquids to flow outside of their protection zone and cause blocks to form, e.g., by letting lava and water mingle to make cobblestone. This setting stops the liquids from flowing. Natual Mob Spawning Outside Of Islands - this setting can prevent mobs from spawning outside of island boundaries. This can help concentrate mob spawning to be within islands. For worlds like AcidIsland, this is not recommended because it appears unnatural. Obsidian scooping - one classic newbie mistake on SkyBlock is to turn your one bucket of lava into obsidian by accidentally having it touch water in the wrong way. This is very common when players make a cobblestone generator and get it wrong. This setting by default enables a \"cheat\" that enables the player to use a bucket on a block of obsidian to return it to lava. This helps prevent players from reseting their island or bothering the admin for more lava. BentoBox checks that the obsidian block is a single block and that there are no other obsidian blocks close to it (+/- 2 blocks) before allowing the scooping. This limits exploitation of this cheat. Offline Growth Management - in general, plants will not grow on a BentoBox island unless the chunk is loaded on the server. Therefore, when players are offline, the plants do not usually grow. However, as visitors may visit an island and cause the chunks to be loaded, the plants can grow and mature. If players are complaining about this edge case, maybe because they have a Redstone machine that handles harvesting, then plant growth can be switched off when island members are not present. Offline Redstone Management - similar to the plant growth option, it may be desirable to disable all Redstone operations when team members are not present. This enables that to happen. Piston management - pistons can be used to create self-powered machines that fly through the air and invade other player's islands. This prevents pistons from operating (pushing) if they are outside the island's protection area. The default is for this prevention to be active because it is a favorite exploit of players. Remove mobs on teleport - this setting will clear the area of any hostile mobs when a player teleports. Admins can adjust what mobs will not be removed via the game mode's config.yml file. This feature helps prevent instant or surprise deaths due to a player teleporting to their home. The default is on. Spawner block protection - For some reason, spawner blocks are often given to SkyBlock players by admins, either as a reward or as a result of a purchase. However, spawner blocks have a vanilla function that enables the mob to be spawned to be changed by a player tapping it with a spawn egg. This prevents that function so that spawner blocks stay the same time. BentoBox also prevents the use of the /spawner or related commands by visitors to an island that can be used to change the type of spawner. Tree growth handling - This prevents trees from growing outside the island's protection range. If trees can do that, it can enable players to intrude into adjacent islands or result in blocks that they cannot access. Wither protection - the Wither has the ability to destroy so much so this flag enables admins to limit the damage the Wither can do.","title":"Protection"},{"location":"BentoBox/About/Protections/#protection","text":"BentoBox provides a full-featured world and island protection system for island GameModes.

Teams enable players to group together on one island. Teams have one owner, or leader, and at least one team member. Team commands # This is a list of team commands available to players. The command is used after the main player command, for example /island team for BSkyBlock. Command Description Permission team manage your team [gamemode].island.team team accept accept an invitation [gamemode].island.team team coop make a player coop rank on your island [gamemode].island.team.coop team demote demote a player on your island down a rank [gamemode].island.team team leave leave your island [gamemode].island.team team invite invite a player to join your island [gamemode].island.team team kick remove a member from your island [gamemode].island.expel team promote promote a player on your island up a rank [gamemode].island.team team reject reject an invitation [gamemode].island.team team setowner transfer your island ownership to a member [gamemode].island.team team trust give a player trusted rank on your island [gamemode].island.team.trust The Main Team Command # The main team command is team . To issue this command you must have an island. If run by itself, it will provide the following information to the player: If the player is the owner, it will tell them how many players they can invite onto their team. It will show all the members of the team. This includes info on the player's ranks, online/offline status, and when they were last seen online. Team Sizes # Teams can be any size and the maximum size can be set globally on a gamemode-basis or determine by a numbered permission given to the team owner. The default max team size is 4. The maximum number of coop and trusted members is also set to 4. Team Member Ranks # BentoBox has the following team ranks built-in: * Owner - this is the owner of the island. There can be only one owner. * Sub-Owner - this is a member rank that has almost the same permissions as the owner. There can be multiple sub-owners. * Member - this is the default member rank. Non-team member ranks # Islands have other ranks that are related to teams but are not team members: * Trusted - this is a non-team member who has permanent permissions on the island, i.e., they have them until they are untrusted by a team member. * Coop - this is a non-team member who has temporary permissions on the island and these permissions will cease if the team member who gave them logs off, or if they are uncoop-ed. * Visitor - this is the default rank for any players who visit the island * Banned - these players have been banned by a team member and cannot enter the island Configurable Rank Commands # The owner of the island is able to grant access to team management commands to lower ranks via the Command Ranks menu in the in-game settings menu. This enables the owner to allow other members to invite other members, for example. Promotion and Demotion # Team members can be promoted or demoted by the island owner or an island member who has the rank required to use these commands. A player cannot demote or promote themselves. Currently, the only promotion or demotion possible is between the ranks of Member and Sub-Owner. In the future, additional ranks or custom ranks may be possible. Joining Teams # Inviting # Players can be invited to join a team using the team invite command. To invite players to join a team, the inviter must be an island owner or have sufficient rank to use the command (see Configurable Rank Command ). Players are invited by name and must be online. Invites can only be made to players who are not already on a team. If a player wants to switch teams, they must leave their current team before they can be invited. Invited players cannot be invited again until they reject the invite. Invited players can only have one active invite at a time. This includes team, coop and trusted invites. If a player receives a new valid invite while another is pending, the old one is replaced by the new invite. If the island team size is already at the maximum, the invite command will tell the user that the island is full. API: After all validation checks are complete, but before the invite is sent, the TeamInviteEvent will be fired. If this event is canceled then the invite will not be sent. Cooldown # Invites can be abused by players, so BentoBox prevents the same player being invited to an island in the cool down period. The cool down is imposed on the island as a whole, so it is not possible for various members of the island to spam another player with invites. The default cool down times for the various invites are: * Team member - 60 minutes * Coop invite - 5 minutes * Trusted invite - 5 minutes See the game mode's config.yml to change. Checking invites # A player can check who has invited them by using the invite command with no arguments. This will show any current team, coop or trusted invites. Accepting an invite # A player accepts an invite by issuing the team invite accept command. Confirmation # The admin can decide whether confirmation is required or not for this command. The default is to require it for team membership but not require it for coop or trusted status. This is because team members lose their island if they join another one. If confirmation is required, the player will receive a warning that if they have an island then it will be lost. Once the player accepts the invite a second time, they will become a team member and teleport to the team island. There is a small chance that the inviter loses the rank required to invite players before the player accepts the invite. In this case, the acceptance will not process and the user will be told that the invite is no longer valid. Accessability: The default cool down response time is set globally for all game modes in BentoBox's config.yml and is 10 seconds. Extend this value if your players need more time to confirm commands. Remember that hitting the up arrow when in command mode will show the previous command so it is not required to type in the whole command again to confirm. API: After all validation checks are complete, but before the invite is sent, the TeamJoinEvent will be fired. If this event is canceled then the invite will not be sent. Once the player has joined the island, there are subsequent events that are fired depending on the invite type: * TeamJoinedEvent that is fired once the player joins the island team. * IslandRankChange is fired to indicate the new player rank of member, trusted or coop. These subsequent events are for notification and cannot be canceled. Process of becoming a team member # BentoBox performs the following steps to make a player a team member: Removes the invite. Removes the player as owner of their old island (remember, team members cannot join another team, so only owners or those with no island can become members). Cleans up the player based on settings - see game mode's config.yml : Ender chest inventory (default: do nothing) Player inventory (default: do not change see note below! ) Money (default: do not zero) Restores health (default: restore all health) Restores hunger (default: remove all hunger) Zeros experience points (default: do not zero) Adds the player as a team member of the new island. Clears out the old home locations. Teleports the player to their new island home. Starts to delete the old island. Resets their death counter, if the admin has set that setting. Tells the player that they have joined the new island. Tells the inviter that the player has joined the team island. Saves the island to the database. Fires the notification events. Reseting Player Inventory Admins should change this setting to clear player's inventory when they join a team! The reason why it is not set is to avoid accidents during installation. Some admins do not understand that joining an island will clear their inventory and so we decided to take the \"do no harm\" approach and leave inventories alone. However, to avoid exploits, it should be cleared. Rejecting an invite # A player rejects an invite by issuing the team invite reject command. A player must have a valid invite to reject otherwise they just receive an error. API: If a player has a valid invite pending then the TeamRejectEvent will be fired. If this event is canceled then the invite will not be rejected and the command will fail silently. The canceling code is recommended to inform the user why the rejection did not happen. Once the validations checks are complete, the invite will be rejected and the inviter will be notified. Changing Team Ownership # Owners can make another team member an owner using the team setowner command with the new owner's name as the parameter. API: After the various checks are done to confirm the command can be executed but before it is executed, the TeamSetownerEvent is fired. If this event is canceled then the ownership change will not occur and the command will fail silently. The canceling code is recommended to inform the user why the change did not happen. Once the ownership changes, there are two IslandRankChange events that are fired: one for the new owner and one for the old owner. Owners must select a new owner before that can leave a team. Kicking A Player # Sometimes a team member needs to be forced out of a team. This is done using the team kick command. The owner can always kick players and the owner can allow lower-ranked team members to kick too via the Command Ranks menu in island settings. The team member does not have to be online to be kicked. The command by default required confirmation. This can be configured in BentoBox's config.yml . When a player is kicked, the following happens: The kicked player is notified (if online) The player is removed from the island If there are any commands configured to be run when a player leaves an island (see the GameMode's config.yml ) then they will be executed at this point. The player is \"cleaned\" based on the config settings: Ender chest is reset (default: do not reset). If the player is offline and resetting is to be done, then it is queued for when they next log in. Inventory reset (default: do not clear). If the player is offline and resetting is to be done, then it is queued for when they next log in. Money reset (default: do not reset). This can happen even if the player is offline. Set health to maximum (default: do not do anything). Only occurs if the player is online. Set food level to maximum (default: do not do anything). Only occurs if the player is online. Zero experience points (default: do not do anything). Only occurs if the player is online. The kicker is informed that the kick is successful. Notification events are fired. API: Two events are fired - TeamKickEvent and IslandRankChangeEvent . The latter notifies that the player now has the Visitor rank. An invite cool down is applied to both the kicker and the kicked player. This helps limit any potential exploits that involve team members kicking players and then inviting them back immediately. Leaving a Team # A player can voluntarily leave a team using the team leave command. The command requires confirmation by default, but this can be switched off in the BentoBox's config. When leaving a team voluntarily, a player may use up one of their allowed island resets. This is set in the GameMode's config and the default is not to lose a reset. If the player will lose a reset, then they will be warned about it if the leave command has a confirmation requirements. Note: is it possible for a player to use up all their resets by leaving a team and therefore not be able to make a new island of their own. That is something admins will have to consider. When a player leaves the island, the sequence and process is the same as when a player is kicked, except that the player may lose a reset. API: After the player leaves the team, two notification events are fired: TeamLeaveEvent and IslandRankChangeEvent . The latter notifies that the player now has the Visitor rank. Trusting and Cooping Other Players # Sometimes players want to help out on other islands without having to join the team as a full member. This can be done by trusting a player or cooping an online player: team trust <player> : the player becomes a permanent member of the island at a rank below Member team coop <player> : the player becomes a temporary member of the island at a rank below Trusted Island owners can trust or coops players and also enable lower-ranked players to use these commands via the Command Ranks page in the island settings. These commands actually send an invite to the player that they can accept or reject, just like the team join command. If the invite is rejected, it will not be possible to send another invite for a cool down period, which is set to 5 minutes by default. This protects players from invite-spam. If a player already has an invite pending from someone else or for a different rank, then that invite will be replaced by this one. Once accepted, the player will receive the rank given for the new island. The inviter is notified of the acceptance. API: One notification event is fired: IslandRankChangeEvent indicating the new Trusted or Coop rank. Coop players hold their rank until the player who invited them logs out, or until the server shuts down, whichever occurs first. Untrusting or uncooping players # Island owners, or players with a high enough rank can issue the team untrusted or team uncoop commands to remove players from the team with these ranks. API: If successful, an IslandRankChangeEvent event will be fired for the affected player marking them now as having the Visitor rank.","title":"Team Handling"},{"location":"BentoBox/About/Teams/#teams","text":"BentoBox manages teams for game modes.

In this case, the acceptance will not process and the user will be told that the invite is no longer valid.

Please add it to the list here . How can I add a new challenge? The official way is to add challenge via Admin GUI. However, there is an option to edit exported database file. It can be done by exporting to file via: /[admin_command] challenges defaults generate . To import file you will need to remove all existing challenges. It can be done by clicking on TNT button in Admin GUI. After that you need to import your file via /[admin_command] challenges defaults import . Reward commands are not working. Why? Most likely reward commands are not working because of incorrect definition. The command does not require / symbol before it. If you want to call command from player perspective, you need to add [SELF] before command call, f.e. [SELF] kill will result in player calling /kill command. How to add placeholders in reward commands? Currently, addon do not support placeholders in reward commands. If that is necessary, you can request them in gitHub. Only placeholder that currently is supported in reward commands is [player] which returns player who completed challenge name. I do not like order of elements in challenge description. Can I change it? Yes, order of elements are defined in addon settings. It can be easily changed in Admin GUI under settings. Challenges description is under Challenges Lore, while challenges levels are under Levels Lore. Translations # Translations for challenges The translations do not cover the challenges.

Please add it to the list here . How can I add a new challenge? The official way is to add challenge via Admin GUI. However, there is an option to edit exported database file. It can be done by exporting to file via: /[admin_command] challenges defaults generate . To import file you will need to remove all existing challenges. It can be done by clicking on TNT button in Admin GUI. After that you need to import your file via /[admin_command] challenges defaults import . Reward commands are not working. Why? Most likely reward commands are not working because of incorrect definition. The command does not require / symbol before it. If you want to call command from player perspective, you need to add [SELF] before command call, f.e. [SELF] kill will result in player calling /kill command. How to add placeholders in reward commands? Currently, addon do not support placeholders in reward commands. If that is necessary, you can request them in gitHub. Only placeholder that currently is supported in reward commands is [player] which returns player who completed challenge name. I do not like order of elements in challenge description. Can I change it? Yes, order of elements are defined in addon settings. It can be easily changed in Admin GUI under settings.

The following items are converted: Players and teams Islands Warps Most Config.yml settings Challenges The following are not converted: Schematics - not supported in BSkyBlock.

Backup # Warning! This software is provided AS-IS without warranty. Use at your own risk and make sure you make a backup copy of your server files and folders. It is very important to do this! Conversion Preparation # Note: No changes are made to the ASkyBlock world except by the server upgrading to the latest version. You will use the same world as you did before with BSkyBlock after conversion. That means it will have the same name.

Steps # Note: that if you world is LARGE then you will need to change the timeout of the server so that the watchdog timer does not stop the server during conversion. You remembered to make a backup of your data right? Edit spigot.yml and change timeout-time: to something large, like 60000 to prevent the watchdog timer stopping the server during conversion. Stop the server and add the Spigot 1.14.4 (or later) server jar to your server folder. Remove the ASkyBlock.jar from your plugins folder. Do NOT remove the ASkyBlock folder or worlds. Install BentoBox Version 1.12.0 (or higher) to your plugins folder. Start the new server with the --forceUpgrade option. This will upgrade all your worlds to the new format. After everything is fully loaded and you see the BentoBox logo, stop the server. Place the BSkyBlock addon, the Challenges addon, the Warps addon and the Converter addon into the BentoBox addons folder. Restart the server, again with the --forceUpgrade option. Once the server is loaded and you see the BentoBox logo, start conversion in the console by entering: bsb convert . After the conversion is complete, stop the server. VERY IMPORTANT. STOP THE SERVER! DO NOT RELOAD!!! This will register the correct world generator. Edit the BSkyBlock config.yml as you see fit in the settings. Edit spigot.yml and return timeout-time: to something small, like 60. Remove the converter addon and the default BSkyBlock world folders that were created. Restart the server. You do not need to use the forceUpgrade option any more. BSkyBlock addon will use the ASkyBlock world. Note: Bentobox uses PAPI or MVdW for placeholders. If you are interested in using placeholders, read the docs on placeholders.

It enables players to build their own biome greenhouses complete with weather, friendly mob spawning, unique plant growth, and even block erosion! Greenhouses are made out of glass and must contain the blocks found in the Biome Recipe to be valid. There is a recipe GUI. Once built, the greenhouse can be used to grow plants with bonemeal, and it may spawn biome-specific mobs. If you include a hopper with water in it, snow will form inside the greenhouse when it rains. If you put bonemeal in the hopper, biome-specific plants will grow. Some blocks can also transform over time due to \"erosion\". Created and maintained by tastybento . Useful links GitHub repository ( Releases ) Issue tracker Development builds ( Latest stable build ) Note for 1.15.x + servers # Biomes have changed so that they take up a 4x4 area and so greenhouse biomes now can bleed outside of the greenhouse. Unfortunately, this cannot be mitigated (as far as I know). If you have a good imagination, you can say that the biome of the greenhouse influences the surroundings a bit and it is natural! So it's a feature, not a bug! Features # Craft your own self-contained biome greenhouse on an island (or elsewhere if you like) Greenhouses can grow plants that cannot normally be grown, like sunflowers Friendly mobs can spawn if your greenhouse is well designed - need slimes? Build a swamp greenhouse! Blocks change in biomes over time - dirt becomes sand in a desert, dirt becomes clay in a river, for example. Greenhouses can run in multiple worlds. Easy to use GUI shows greenhouse recipes (e.g. /is greenhouses ) Admins can fully customize biomes and recipes How to Build A Greenhouse # This example is for when you are in the BSkyBlock world. For AcidIsland, just use /ai instead of /island. Make glass blocks and build a rectangular set of walls with a flat roof. Put a hopper in the wall or roof. Put a door in the wall so you can get in and out. Type /island greenhouses and read the rules for the greenhouse you want. Exit the GUI and place blocks, water, lava, and ice so that you make your desired biome. Type /island greenhouses again and click on the biome to make it. Type /island greenhouses help to see other options. Once made: # Use bonemeal to grow small plants on grass blocks immediately in the greenhouse. Or place bonemeal in the hopper to have the greenhouse sprinkle bonemeal automatically. Come back later to see what grows! Place a bucket of water (or more) in the hopper to cause snow to fall in cold biomes. Snow will fall when it rains in the world. Each snowfall empties one bucket of water. Friendly biome-specific mobs may spawn in your greenhouse - the usual rules apply (be more than 24 blocks away). FAQ # Can I use stained glass? Yes, you can. It's pretty. Can I fill my greenhouse full of water? Yes. That's an ocean. Will a squid spawn there? Maybe... okay, yes it will if it's a big enough ocean. How do I place a door high up in the wall if the wall is all glass? Place it on a hopper. How do I place a door on a hopper? Crouch and then place it. Can I use metal doors? Yes. Can I use a trap door? Yes. Can I grow swamp flowers with this? Yes. Make a swamp biome and use bonemeal. How much bonemeal is used to grow plants? One per successful plant. How much water do I need to put into the hopper to make it snow? One bucket of water (just the water) is used up every time it rains. This only happens in cold biomes. Can I build a Nether greenhouse? Try it and see... (Actually, you may need permission) Can I build greenhouses in the Nether? Yes. You can colonize the nether with them. What kind of mobs spawn in the biomes? It's what you would expect, wolves in Cold Taiga, horses on plains, etc. Required Plugin # This version of Greenhouses is an add-on for BentoBox and will not run stand-alone!

Please add it to the list here . How can I add a new generator tier? Currently, addon supports 3 ways how to add a new generator: By using ingame GUI that is available via /[admin] generator command. By adding generator to a template file. By adding generator to the exported database file. I added generator to the template/database file, but it does not shows up in game. For easier configuration with multiple gamemodes, generators are stored in the internal database. After editing template or database file, you need to import them into that memory. You can do it via Admin GUI by clicking on Import Template or Import Database buttons. I have a generator that shows up in Admin GUI, but players do not see it. Most likely it is because of \"deployment\" status. To avoid with issues when players starts to activate generators while an admin is adding them, generators are undeployed and noone can use them. You can activate them by editing generator via Admin GUI and clicking on lever in Edit Generator GUI. What is treasures? Treasures are things that are dropped uppon block generation. It allows to give an extra customization for each generator. What is bundles? Bundles is a feature that allows customizing experience for each island even more. If bundle is assigned to an island, then players on that island will be able to use only generators from that bundle. Can I disable showing required permissions in generator description? Yes, addon provides a lot of customization options for displaying each generator. It is located in locales file: # Generator lore message generator. All elements in generator lore is generated # based on section below. generator: # Main lore element content.

Please add it to the list here . How can I add a new generator tier? Currently, addon supports 3 ways how to add a new generator: By using ingame GUI that is available via /[admin] generator command. By adding generator to a template file. By adding generator to the exported database file. I added generator to the template/database file, but it does not shows up in game. For easier configuration with multiple gamemodes, generators are stored in the internal database. After editing template or database file, you need to import them into that memory. You can do it via Admin GUI by clicking on Import Template or Import Database buttons. I have a generator that shows up in Admin GUI, but players do not see it. Most likely it is because of \"deployment\" status. To avoid with issues when players starts to activate generators while an admin is adding them, generators are undeployed and noone can use them. You can activate them by editing generator via Admin GUI and clicking on lever in Edit Generator GUI. What is treasures? Treasures are things that are dropped uppon block generation. It allows to give an extra customization for each generator. What is bundles? Bundles is a feature that allows customizing experience for each island even more. If bundle is assigned to an island, then players on that island will be able to use only generators from that bundle. Can I disable showing required permissions in generator description? Yes, addon provides a lot of customization options for displaying each generator. It is located in locales file: # Generator lore message generator.

Useful links GitHub repository ( Releases ) Issue tracker Development builds ( Latest stable build ) About # OneBlock puts you on a block in space. There is only one block. What do you do next? Development Status # The game is in Beta stage. Commands # The user command is /ob . The admin command is /oba . FAQ # Q: What phases are there? A: There are 11 phases: Plains, Underground, Winter, Ocean, Jungle, Swamp, Dungeon, Desert, The Nether, Plenty, Desolation, and The End. Each phase features a set of blocks, items, and mobs appropriate for the setting. Q: How many blocks are there in the 11 phases? A: There are currently 11 thousand blocks! Q: What happens after the last phase? A: The phases repeat. Q: Why do I keep falling and dying! A: There are tricks to surviving, but it might be difficult! You need to build defenses. Q: Why do certain blocks spawn more frequently than others? A: They just do! You can set the relative probability in the config files in the phases folder. Q. How do I know which is the magic block? A. Hit it and it will give out green particles. Q. My magic block is no longer there! How do I get another one? A. You will have to place a block there. Worse case, kill yourself and one will be generated. Q. My magic block is liquid! How can I mine it? A. Use a bucket. Q: Which mobs can spawn? A: Each phase has a different set of mobs that can spawn. Be careful because they may push you off! If you listen carefully, you may hear hostile mobs coming. Q. I have no chance to react to hostile mobs spawning! A. Be prepared. Listen carefully when you mine a block and you will hear hostile mobs coming before they spawn. If you are in a hostile phase, then expect mobs and build defenses to protect yourself. You can mine a block from quite far away. Q. When mobs spawn, my defenses are destroyed! Why? A. Mobs make space to spawn. If there's anything in the way, it'll be broken and dropped. You'll have to build accordingly. Q: Do chests spawn? A: Yes. Chests spawn with random items in them from the current phase. There are common, uncommon, rare and epic chests. Chests with sparkles are good. Q: Is it possible to reach the Nether or End in this map? A: The vanilla Nether exists by default but there is no End world. Q: What is the end goal? A: It's whatever you want it to be! Q. Should I use the Levels addon? A. It's up to you, but if you do be aware that levels could get high because players have an infinite block. I prefer not to use it and instead use the Likes addon. Installation # Install BentoBox and run it on the server at least once to create its data folders. Place this jar in the addons folder of the BentoBox plugin. Restart the server. The addon will create worlds and a data folder and inside the folder will be a config.yml and config files in phases folder. Stop the server. Edit config.yml and the .yml config files how you want. Delete any worlds that were created by default if you made changes that would affect them. Restart the server. Phase config files # The config files to make the phases are in the phases folder. There are two files per phase - a file that contains the blocks and mobs, and a file that contains the chests. The first number of any file is how many blocks need to be mined to reach that phase. This is the phase's key number. Each phase also has a name, a biome and the following sections: blocks mobs In the chests file, it just has the phase number and a chests section. blocks # The blocks section list Bukkit Materials followed by a relative probability. All the probability values are added up for the whole phase and the chance of the block being placed is the relative probability divided by the total of all the probabilities. mobs # The mob section list mobs that can spawn and their relative probability along with blocks. You can only list entities that are alive and can spawn in this list. chests # If CHEST is listed in the blocks section, then it will be randomly filled according to this section. You can define as many chests as you like. The first number is a unique chest number. Then follows the chest contents that includes the slot number and the item stack contents. Finally there is the chest's rarity, which can be COMMON, UNCOMMON, RARE or EPIC. The best way to set chests is to do it in game.

A: There are 11 phases: Plains, Underground, Winter, Ocean, Jungle, Swamp, Dungeon, Desert, The Nether, Plenty, Desolation, and The End. Each phase features a set of blocks, items, and mobs appropriate for the setting. Q: How many blocks are there in the 11 phases? A: There are currently 11 thousand blocks! Q: What happens after the last phase? A: The phases repeat. Q: Why do I keep falling and dying! A: There are tricks to surviving, but it might be difficult! You need to build defenses. Q: Why do certain blocks spawn more frequently than others? A: They just do! You can set the relative probability in the config files in the phases folder. Q. How do I know which is the magic block? A. Hit it and it will give out green particles. Q. My magic block is no longer there! How do I get another one? A. You will have to place a block there. Worse case, kill yourself and one will be generated. Q. My magic block is liquid! How can I mine it? A. Use a bucket. Q: Which mobs can spawn? A: Each phase has a different set of mobs that can spawn. Be careful because they may push you off! If you listen carefully, you may hear hostile mobs coming. Q. I have no chance to react to hostile mobs spawning! A. Be prepared. Listen carefully when you mine a block and you will hear hostile mobs coming before they spawn. If you are in a hostile phase, then expect mobs and build defenses to protect yourself. You can mine a block from quite far away. Q. When mobs spawn, my defenses are destroyed! Why? A. Mobs make space to spawn. If there's anything in the way, it'll be broken and dropped. You'll have to build accordingly. Q: Do chests spawn? A: Yes. Chests spawn with random items in them from the current phase. There are common, uncommon, rare and epic chests. Chests with sparkles are good. Q: Is it possible to reach the Nether or End in this map? A: The vanilla Nether exists by default but there is no End world. Q: What is the end goal? A: It's whatever you want it to be! Q. Should I use the Levels addon? A. It's up to you, but if you do be aware that levels could get high because players have an infinite block. I prefer not to use it and instead use the Likes addon.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"gamemodes/AOneBlock/#installation","text":"Install BentoBox and run it on the server at least once to create its data folders.

The default is 400, so the land will be 800 x 800 blocks. The land is semi-random, but each player will get roughly the same layout (see the biomes config). Structures such as villages, broken nether gates, shipwrecks, etc. are random and so some players may get them, others not. In a future version, switching off structures will be a config option. Strongholds are switched off and do not exist. Each player's land is surrounded by seas of different temperatures. If the border is not solid, then players can theoretically explore other lands.

The second setting unknown-advancement-increase gives any unknown advancements, i.e., ones not listed in this file, a default value.
